## Dasync

Collection of general things that I've made. I'd like to think they work, no guarantees though.

#Fibers

Job based fiber system. Based off http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1022186/Parallelizing-the-Naughty-Dog-Engine but with queue per thread.

#Pipeline

Based off the Facebook pipelines, but is completely static and set at compile time.
